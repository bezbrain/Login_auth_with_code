# Makeene Auth

#### Stronger Login Authentication:

Introduction: Makeene Auth is a web application that assures a stronger authentication without necessarily needing to get code on phone number or email address.

##### This is a Simple but technical project that has the following features:

- Complete user authentication
- Code generation from the frontend, making usage of getting code via phone number, email address or any external means to not be necessary.
- Route protection

#### How to use:

- Register as a new user.
- Login if you already have an account.
  Note: To login, this is where code generation is needed.
- Click the "Get Code" button which opens a new tab to generate the code.
  Note: This code will only be available for just 30 seconds.
- If code expires, you can always generate a new one.
- When code is generated, quickly navigate back to the login page to input the code.
- If the code does not expire before you input it, then you will be granted access to the landing page.

#### Summary

This availability of the code for some seconds before it expires is to allow for stronger authentication and protect users' account.
